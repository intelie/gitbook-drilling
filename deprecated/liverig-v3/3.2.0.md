## Fix "Renormalization Throttle" save

We fixed a bug that prevents the "renormalization throttle" card (located inside the Additional Features screen) fails to save due to a 415 error.

## Always show Channels Management 'unconfigured channels'

Until now, the "[not configured channels](../../administration/data-normalization/data-management/channels-management.md#not-configured-channels)" button was only being displayed when:

* the logged user has "manage asset" permission
* the "Channels Management" is not in edit mode

From this version on, it will always be visible on the Channels Management.

## Fixes "import JSON" caret color when using Live 3.1.0 or higher

Changed the caret color from black to #f8f8f0
