# Configuration

Ideally, one liverig-collector should be installed on each monitored asset (rig, platform, fleet, and so on).

{% hint style="info" %}
As shown in the [Data Normalization](../../data-flow/data-normalization/) section, the data normalization process highly relies on the data format and metadata generated by liverig-collector. Thus, this process only works completely when the collector is used.
{% endhint %}

The collector is a Java (8 or above) software that runs on a Unix machine (usually CentOS 7), either physical or virtual.

All the configuration of the collector and its integrations is performed via a user-friendly web interface. When performed by Intelie, all the deployment and configuration process is managed by Ansible.

{% hint style="success" %}
The only way in that the collector would be unnecessary is when Live is used exclusively to analyze Simulation Data, that could be generated by the Well Drive plugin for example.
