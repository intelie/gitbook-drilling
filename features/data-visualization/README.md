# Charts

The creation of some charts in Intelie Live does not require any programming skills. On those charts, simply select the asset (rig or well) and the channels to be displayed that the plot will start, both for real time and historical data.

All the charts below depend on the [data normalization](../../data-flow/data-normalization/) process and use the normalized data.

[Many other charts](https://platform.intelie.com/data-visualization/standard-widgets) can be created, although they depend on Intelie Pipes knowledge.
